<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a simple implementation of the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction in python.
It is done both in an OOP version which the PCA class could be imported in a seperate project and be used, and in a simple fuction to be used in a stand-alone script.
clearly this project is for educational purposes and does not have much practical power,
for more practical uses one could refer to [scikit-learns's](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) packages.


### Built With

* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
* [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
